Problem<br/>
InnovateTech needed a professional and attractive website to showcase their tech products and engage with their customers. The goal was to create a website that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and responsive on different devices. We also wanted to include key sections like Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Sign Up to provide comprehensive information and functionalities.<br/>

Our Approach<br/>
Planning and Design: We started by identifying the key requirements and features for the website. We then created wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout and design. A cohesive color scheme and typography were chosen to maintain a consistent look and feel.
<br/>
Implementation: The website was built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. We focused on creating a responsive design that works well on various devices.
<br/>
Testing and Optimization: We tested the website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it looked good and functioned well everywhere. We also optimized the code for better performance and maintainability.
<br/>
Features of Our Solution<br/>
Responsive Navigation Bar: This includes links to the Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Sign-Up pages. It also has a search bar for easy navigation and a sign-up button that stands out.
<br/>
Home Page: This page welcomes visitors with an introduction to InnovateTech and features some of our products and services.
<br/>
About Us Page: Here, we provide detailed information about InnovateTech and its founder, Yashveer Singh. We also share the company’s mission, vision, and values.
<br/>
Contact Us Page: This section allows users to get in touch with InnovateTech. It includes a map, contact information, and a form for inquiries.
<br/>
Sign-Up Page: This page has a form for users to create an account. The form includes required fields and validation to ensure accurate information.
<br/>
Challenges We Faced<br/>
Ensuring a consistent design across all pages.<br/>
Making sure the website is responsive and looks good on various devices.<br/>
Creating intuitive and user-friendly navigation.<br/>
Validating form inputs to enhance user experience.<br/>
Design and Architecture<br/>
Layout<br/>
The website layout is structured using HTML and styled with CSS. We used Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive grid system. The design follows a modern aesthetic with a clean layout and a color scheme that reflects the brand identity.<br/>

CSS<br/>
We organized our CSS files to separate general styles (styles.css) from page-specific styles (about.css, contact.css, signup.css). Media queries are used to ensure the site adapts to different screen sizes.
<br/>
JavaScript<br/>
We used JavaScript to add interactivity, like the responsive navigation menu and form validation. The script is included in the HTML files and kept minimal for easy maintenance.

Website has been added with better CSS and JS for more functionalities and pleasing look. Website has been modified to make it more responsive.<br/>
Some of the changes made in page are:<BR/>
-> Added more functional search bar that will run an sorting algorithm to find the desired product for you.<br/>
-> Added homepage link on website name for easier access.<br/>
-> Added products link in intro of website. <br/>
<br/>
Products has been added for users and a personal information page has been designed to collect data for delivery purposes.<br/>
Products > description > price > buy button. The arrangement for the products page has been done in this particular format.<br/>
Soon a payment page will be added for user to pay for the product selected.<br/>
<h5>New problem encountered</h5><br/>
Currently getting some problems related to redirecting user from a form page to another page for example: when you want to signup in the website, you click on signup formand when you click submit, it will run into an error of ERROR 405. Also when you go to buy a product you will encounter the same problem where you will find an informtion form for colleting your data for delivery purposes. After submitting this form you should be redirected to another page where it will ask for your card details to complete payment. I used AI to create me an API as I do not have any knowledge of creating APIs. So after creating API, I connected it to a HTML page designed it for accepting payments. But it is also not working. I ave tried different methods to rediect user to new webpage but all of them failed.<br/>
